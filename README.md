#Geographic Coordinate Density Analysis within a given range#

**Description:**
This Python script performs geographic coordinate analysis using a dataset of latitude, longitude, and speed values [ In our datasets, we have vehcile speed at that co-ordinate. You can remove or tweak according to your datasets]. It calculates the haversine distance between pairs of coordinates, identifies clusters of nearby points, and provides insights into their distribution and average speeds.

**Features:**
- Calculates haversine distance between coordinates to measure geographic proximity.
- Determines the number of points within a given distance for each unique coordinate.
- Identifies and selects specific points based on their counts and distances, while avoiding overlap.
- Computes average speeds for selected points.
- Creates a DataFrame containing selected points, their counts, and average speeds.
- Reads and processes data from a CSV file.
- Exports the final results to a new CSV file for further analysis.

**Usage:**
1. Ensure the input CSV file (cas_fcw.csv) contains columns 'Lat', 'Long', and 'Speed'.
2. Run the script to perform coordinate analysis and point selection.
3. Results are stored in 'tryit.csv', including latitude, longitude, point count, and average speed.

**Note:**
The script utilizes the haversine formula for distance calculation, making it suitable for geographical data analysis. This can be useful for identifying clusters of points, tracking hotspots, or understanding the distribution of points in a geographic dataset.

By leveraging the average speed values from the dataset, this script offers an enhanced perspective on spatial arrangements and vehicle behavior.
